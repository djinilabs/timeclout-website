In the high-pressure world of hospitality, scheduling isn’t just an administrative task—it’s a daily puzzle that directly impacts your bottom line, staff morale, and guest experience.

For years, restaurant and hotel managers have relied on legacy platforms to digitize their rosters. While these tools replaced the whiteboard, many simply moved the manual work from a wall to a screen. You’re still dragging, dropping, and calculating hours in your head.

Enter **TimeClout**.

We built TimeClout to move beyond _digitizing_ schedules to _automating_ them. Below, we’ll dive into a fair, head-to-head comparison between TimeClout and the industry giants—7shifts, Deputy, and Sling—to help you decide which tool belongs in your tech stack.

### **The Hospitality Scheduling Landscape**

Before we compare, let's look at the main players we are evaluating:

- **TimeClout:** The AI-first challenger focused on intelligent automation and "one-click" scheduling.
- **7shifts:** A restaurant-specific platform known for its deep POS integrations and communication tools.
- **Deputy:** A workforce management tool with a strong focus on labor law compliance and complex rostering.
- **Sling:** A popular choice for communication-centric teams, offering free basic scheduling.

### **Deep Dive: How TimeClout Stands Out**

While our competitors are robust, they often suffer from "feature bloat"—charging you for payroll and HR tools you might not need. TimeClout focuses on solving the single biggest pain point: **Building the schedule.**

#### **1. True AI Automation vs. "Smart" Copy-Paste**

- **The Competition:** Most platforms, like 7shifts and Deputy, rely on "templates." You build a perfect week once and copy it over. This works fine until someone requests time off, a holiday hits, or your demand forecast changes. Then, you're back to manually tetris-ing shifts.
- **The TimeClout Advantage:** TimeClout uses an intelligent AI solver. You define the rules—staff qualifications (e.g., "Must be a Mixologist"), availability, and fairness preferences—and TimeClout generates the optimal schedule from scratch every time. It doesn't just copy last week; it solves _next_ week's specific problems.

#### **2. Conflict Prevention vs. Detection**

- **The Competition:** Tools like Sling and 7shifts are great at flagging conflicts _after_ you make a mistake. You drag a shift to "Sarah," and a red box pops up saying she's unavailable.
- **The TimeClout Advantage:** Our system prevents the conflict before it happens. When you use Auto-Fill, TimeClout’s algorithm already knows Sarah is unavailable or that John is approaching overtime. It simply won't suggest them for that slot, saving you the mental load of trial-and-error.

#### **3. Fairness as a Feature**

- **The Competition:** In busy restaurants, "clopenings" (closing then opening) and unfair shift distributions are common complaints that lead to burnout. Managers often miss these nuances when scheduling manually on Deputy or 7shifts.
- **The TimeClout Advantage:** TimeClout allows you to set parameters for staff well-being, such as minimum rest times between shifts and fair distribution of "prime" shifts (like Friday nights). This boosts retention by proving to your team that their burnout is being actively managed by the system.

#### **4. Cost & Accessibility**

- **The Competition:** Platforms like Deputy and 7shifts can get expensive quickly as you add modules like "Engagement" or "Labor Compliance."
- **The TimeClout Advantage:** We are currently in **Private Beta**, offering full access to our premium AI features for free. This is a strategic opportunity for forward-thinking managers to adopt cutting-edge tech without the enterprise price tag.

### **The Verdict**

**Stick with the legacy players (7shifts/Deputy) if:**

- You need deep, immediate integration with a specific legacy POS system today.
- You are looking for a full-suite HR and Payroll platform rather than just a scheduling tool.

**Switch to TimeClout if:**

- You are tired of spending 4+ hours a week "fixing" the schedule.
- You want a tool that does the thinking for you, ensuring coverage and compliance automatically.
- You want to join a platform where your feedback directly shapes the product's future.
